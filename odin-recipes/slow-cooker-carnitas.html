    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carnitas means 'little meats' and is traditionally fried then braised. This recipe
         is made much easier using the slow cooker but the results are just as tasty. 
         This makes a great filling for tamales, enchiladas, tacos and burritos. This 
         filling is also great combined with your favorite barbecue sauce and served on buns.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon crumbled dried oregano</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 (4 pound) boneless pork shoulder roast</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together salt, garlic powder, cumin, oregano, coriander, and cinnamon in a bowl. 
            Coat pork with the spice mixture. Place the bay leaves in the bottom of a slow cooker 
            and place the pork on top. Pour the chicken broth around the sides of the pork, being 
            careful not to rinse off the spice mixture.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook on Low until the pork shreds easily with a fork, about 10 hours. Turn 
            the meat after it has cooked for 5 hours. When the pork is tender, remove from slow 
            cooker, and shred with two forks. Use cooking liquid as needed to moisten the meat.</li>
    </ol>
